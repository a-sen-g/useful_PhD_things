Postdoc App Advice

### Thanks to Franceso and Eline for the advice!
- Have these documents ready _beforehand_, since often you'll find out about positions very close to their application deadlines:
	- CV
	- Research Proposal
	- Cover Letter
		- For positions where CVs and publications had to be emailed, Eline wrote the cover letter as the body of the email instead of a separate letter attachment
	- Separate list of publications
- **Having something like a spreadsheet to manage and track applications**
- Don't apply to a dead group. Make sure they _are_ publishing and are participating in contemporary discourse.
- Sometimes your eligibility for applying somewhere is dependent where you apply from. For example, some cosmological experimental groups are open to _EU_ applicants (specific example: SKA might be looking for applicants from a particular set of regions). Important to consider whether a postoc position will take you outside the region of research, and if that might affect your ability to stay within a field or join a particular group/project.
	- Might be important to think about how to maintain a presence, say in EU or US, despite not being posted there as a postdoc, in order to make it possible to apply there for a 2nd postdoc, etc.
- Reference letters
	- Have **3** willing referees (e.g. PhD supervisor + 2 collaborators, perhaps from other unis).
		- Cosmology positions typically require 3 letters, other fields may ask for 2.
	- Ask **early**.
	- Be prepared to remind referees.
	- Reference letters rarely make an application successful, they're really a formality. Make sure other parts of app are strong, and make sure the reference letter doesn't _harm_ your app.
- **AAS Job Register** (jobregister.aas.org) <- check this for postdoc advertisements
	- _Worldwide_ platform for groups to advertise jobs in _astronomy_.
- **Academic Jobs Online** (https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo) <- another postdoc advertisement platform
- Check whether the postdoc positions have teaching or supervisorial duties attached.
	- e.g. UK/EU positions typically include teaching responsibilities. Outside of UK+EU+USA, postdocs can sometimes be considered as students and therefore not have teaching duties.
- Check the funding source, this can determine the nature of the position (the flexibility of the research question)
- Postdoc **research fellowship** positions are worth applying for, even though their application process is _more involved_.
	- Generally more research freedom.
	- Application will involve additional things like grant proposal letters.
	- You are essentially employed by your funding sponsor.
	- USA often gives more freedom, EU might not give much freedom at all (sometimes you get research freedom after a postdoc delivers on assigned _"deliverables"_).
- Interview advice
	- Be aware of what the group researches
		- Read abstracts of papers like reviews, etc.
		- Prepare questions for the group you are applying to. An interview is a **2-way** process.
			- Eline sometimes asks the researchers what they think they'll be researching in the future (i.e. to ask about whether any recent grants for particular research topics have been granted, since this _could_ influence your prospective work).
	- Interviews may not be called interviews; assume _any_ interaction with a group is an interview (e.g. "informal chat", "meeting the group", etc.).
		- This includes interactions **without your intended supervisor(s)**. For example, if you are asked to meet _students_, these students may report back to memebers on the admission panel. _Make a good impression_ (e.g. be friendly and supportive), be _professional_ (don't excessively fool/joke around).
		- "Be the seminar speaker you wanted as a PhD student" - Francesco
	- Have presentation slides ready, but **always assume that you will give a presentation without it**.
	- There are _standard_ interview questions - read up on what these questions are, and prepare for them (Eline has a list). E.g. "What drew you to this position?", "Tell us about your recent work", etc. More examples from Eline (from Phil and Chris):
		- What attracted you to this position, and why would you want to come work in this group?
		- What skills do you think you can bring to this role?
		- Tell me about what you have been doing during your phd
		- Tell us about a particular piece of work you are proud of
		- I saw in your research proposal that you were interested in doing ‘x’, can you tell us about how you would go about that?
			- Prepare 1-2 presentation slides in anticipation of these questions.
	- Ask for mock interviews from supervisors and faculty members you know.
