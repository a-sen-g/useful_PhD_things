## Careers in cosmology
### Thanks to Tim, Dan, and Bill

- **Research fellowships** (handled by funding body); expect applicant to provide research proposal
	- Given out by individual institutions (1-2 a year per institution typically, sometimes funding bodies.
	- Oxbridge ([JRFs](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/funding/jrfs)?) are a good source since each college might have one position.
		- Advertised by individual colleges and in advertisement sections of gazettes (e.g. https://gazette.web.ox.ac.uk/ ) and on job website pages (e.g. Oxford's one: https://my.corehr.com/pls/uoxrecruit/erq_search_version_4.start_search_with_params?p_company=10&p_internal_external=E&p_display_in_irish=N&p_competition_type=RE&p_force_type=E )
	- Pots of money to apply for with own research proposals
		- [1851 Research Fellowships](https://royalcommission1851.org/fellowships/research-fellowships)
		- [Lindemann Fellowship](https://www.esu.org/lindemann-trust-fellowship/)
	- Reviewers mainly care about focused research in CV, extracurriculars don't matter so much. _Depth_ of knowledge.
	- Reviewers often send applications to experts (who the applicant may not know or be told about) in the field to check research proposals.
	- https://ras.ac.uk/awards-and-grants/fellowships
	- https://royalcommission1851.org/fellowships/research-fellowships
	- [CERN fellowships](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/CERN/fellowships)
	- After first postdocs, one can consider "advanced" fellowships (e.g. Ernest Rutherford fellowships, [University Research Fellowships](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/)).
	- Another second+ postdoc fellowship scheme is the [Stephen Hawking fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/stephen-hawking-fellowship/).
		- Having an advanced fellowship guarantee funding at a university often helps in progressing to a tenured (permanent) position at a university. The application is made _with the support of the university the position will be held at._ Typically, universities can only support one application per round, so this is selective. Need to impress a uni research group very well.
- (Posdoctoral Research Assistant, **"PDRA route"**) Universities might apply for funding. If so, money provided to university for a project the university has already shared. Applicants would be applying to a known project.
	- More common.
	- Typically the case for joining data projects like EUCLID.
	- Typically want someone a bit more flexible than for a fellowship position. _Breadth_ of knowledge.
	- In this route, typically the supervisor (i.e. the one holding the funding and overseeing the position) is known, so the person to impress and do background research on is known.
- Just knowing about your own PhD project is generally not enough. Have to read more widely and be aware of research in the community. Want to demonstrate a degree of versatility.
	- Think about _skills_ you can pick up - these will be useful in enabling applications in topics not directly relevant to PhD. Coding langauges like Python, C, **Boltzmann codes**, etc. 
	- Also mathematical techniques, perhaps particular types of perturbation theories of field theory techniques.
	- e.g. read LIGO papers.
- Personal statement = "your journey", extracurricular things are nice to mention here
- Application culling criteria examples: # of publications (at least 2), research proposal well-written
	- Not satisfying these might mean your application is rejected without even being fully read.
	- **Get experienced people to read over application material. Supervisor, second supervisor, etc.**
- Research proposal
	- Must be concrete. "I want to simulate Horndeski models" is not enough. Demonstrate that there has been thought in considering whether what is being proposed is feasible within the proposed position's timeframe. 
	- Good to demonstrate idea of what stages the project might involve.
	- Prove capability of research independence of applicant.
- 2 opportunities to apply:
	- Start of 3rd year (perhaps more speculatively)
	- Start of 4th year (in my case, the 4th year is a half year)
- **Speak to proposed supervisor, group before the application**. Networking is important. 
	- Giving **(seminar) talks** is a great way to network.
